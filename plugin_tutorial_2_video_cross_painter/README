This is the example of the GStreamer video plugin that uses GstVideoFilter
and GstVideoFrame, implementing gst_my_video_transform_frame_ip.

It acquires the size of the video input, bytes per pixel and bytes per line,
prints this data and then draws the hair cross moving right and down as the
frames advance.

The skeleton for the plugin has been generated.
